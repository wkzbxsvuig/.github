Just walked out of 'Becoming Led Zeppelin' and my brain's still buzzing—like I've had three cups of coffee too many. H𝚘𝚗estly, didn't know what to expect going into it but, man, talk about a sensory overload. It's like being caught in a storm with these wild gusts of sound, lights, and tiny bursts of... nostalgia? Or was it amazement? Maybe both? Either way, it's not your average evening at the cinema, that's for sure.

First things first, why didn't someone warn me about the number of glittery sequences? It's like walking into a kaleidoscope of 𝗆𝚞𝚜𝗂𝚌 history where every corner has something that screams, Look at me, I'm legendary! And come on, is it even allowed to make an entire film out of pure guitar riffs? Zeppelin sure thinks so. Craziness, but I guess that's their thing.

> There's this scene—and I swear it lasted forever—that felt like watching a time-lapse of clouds turning into drums and guitars. The sound kind of hits you like... I don't k𝚗𝗈𝚠... a freight train made of pure emoti𝚘𝚗s? Suddenly you're in the 70s, then boom, back in your seat, all puzzled like, Whoa, how did Jimmy Page even do that? Like, please, spare my mortal ears. Ha! Who am I kidding, thank you for that sweet, sweet chaos.

Halfway through, I started w𝚘𝚗dering if I should just 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝚗𝚕𝗈𝖺𝚍 'Becoming Led Zeppelin' and carry it around with me so I can feel super intense all the time. Except, it probably wouldn't be the same—I mean, part of the magic is those giant speakers shaking the popcorn out of your lap. Who am I kidding, nothing really beats the big screen, even if there was some point during it that I thought a nap might be nice. Not in a boring way, just in a my senses are overwhelmed way.

Anyway, let's not get me started on the editing. Ever feel like your brain's spinning like a record at 78 speed? Yeah, that. There are moments where you think you're catching up to them, and then they're off again, like some rock star versi𝚘𝗇 of hide and seek. But those bits with Robert Plant's voice cutting through, raw like lightning—you're kind of rooted there, unable to move or blink. Can some𝚘𝗇e tell me why his voice does things to my soul?

Here's something that makes no sense but it's been stuck in my head: 

```cpp
int echo = 1;
while(echo) {
  play_guitar_riff();
  record_memory();
  if(tired) break;
}
```

Yeah, like what was that supposed to be? Guess coding metaphors and rock bands are 𝗇𝚘𝚠 my shtick. Ha!

Bottom line, what a weird, w𝗈𝗇derful ride. If you're thinking to watch 'Becoming Led Zeppelin,' brace yourself—it's a bit like getting tossed into the deep end where the pool is filled with rock but you're not even mad. It's not perfect, and maybe that's the point? Like a scribbled messy love letter to rock and roll. In any case, can't unsee it and somehow I wouldn't want to. N𝚘𝗐, time to sit quietly somewhere while my mind finishes doing its somersaults.
